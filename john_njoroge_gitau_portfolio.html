      <h2>About Me </h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">I am Gitau John Njoroge, born on a crisp February 12th in 2003. My journey through the corridors of education has been a thrilling adventure. It all began in 2008, a wide-eyed, curious child, venturing into the world of formal education. The pages of my life turned as I embarked on my academic odyssey. My early years in primary school were marked by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore the limitless horizons of learning. In 2016, with boundless determination, I successfully completed my primary education, laying the foundation for my future endeavors. The transition to secondary school in 2017 marked a new chapter. These formative years were not only about academics but also about personal growth, friendships, and nurturing my innate passion for technology. The years from 2017 to 2021 were a whirlwind of experiences, challenges, and achievements. I not only excelled academically but also engaged in various extracurricular activities like Sports. It was during this time that I discovered my true calling - computer science. The world of coding, algorithms, and problem-solving fascinated me. This revelation propelled me into a journey of self-discovery. In 2021, I proudly graduated from secondary school, my heart set on the fascinating world of computer science. Kirinyaga University became my next destination, where I enrolled in a Computer Science course. This was a pivotal moment in my life. The university provided the perfect platform to pursue my passion. Today, I am a university student, exploring the realms of computer science, diving into the intricate world of programming, software development, and artificial intelligence. With a heart full of dreams and a head full of ideas, I am committed to making a positive impact on the world through technology. My journey is one of perseverance, ambition, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge, and I'm excited to see where it will lead me.</p>
